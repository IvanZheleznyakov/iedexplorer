========================  IEDExplorer ========================


The IEDExplorer project has been created in my free time in order to learn the IEC61850 protocol.
The result is the only (as I have seen over Internet) pure .net managed MMS stack (not complete yet)
and a very basic IEC61850 MMS client implementation.

The code is NOT in production quality, written by a non-professional programmer:
- it completely lacks tests
- it uses Binary Notes implementation of MMS ASN.1 encoding/decoding, which is relatively
  slow in the C# flavour, thus not really suitable for a serious usage
- it has a simplistic UI and UI bindings (needs some refactoring)
- IEC61850 is modelled in a very simple manner, and model is incomplete (refactoring needed)
- the MMS client side only has been implemented

On the other side:
- it works (at least for me on some test setups)
- it has already helped me in some situations in debugging 61850 communications
- it has a big potential for improvement
- it can be a free alternative to some commercial test utilities
- it runs under Windows and under Linux/Mono

The project is looking for enthusiastic programmers who want to explore the mysterious
world of IEC61850 protocol.
